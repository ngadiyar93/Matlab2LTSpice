# Link Matlab and LTSpice
This repository has code that uses Matlab to simulate in LTSpice. The code included does the following for an example R-L Circuit:
1. Create netlist
2. Simulate in LT Spice
3. Plot results

The LTspice2Matlab.m is forked from https://github.com/PeterFeicht/ltspice2matlab to enable reading the ltspice outputs.
